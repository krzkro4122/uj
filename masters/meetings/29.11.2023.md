## Concerns

1. Thesis' language: Can I write it in english or just polish (ðŸ¤¢)?

2. I much prefer PyTorch, is that ok or should i use Tensorflow/Keras?

3. PLGrid account - is just loggin-in ok or do i have to do/activate sth more?

4. What should the thesis' format be:
  a. comparing different ViT approaches with each other? (current State-of-the-art for different architectures we talked about)
  b. try to max-out one chosen approach/architecture (train, test and tune it myself) and compare with one SoTA?

5. What dataset to pick:
  a. Can I use Ready/Open datasets? (LSUN bedroom, CelebA, CIFAR etc.)
  b. Should i try to create my own, curated dataset? (probably would be bad since transformers need quite a bit of data to scale well)
